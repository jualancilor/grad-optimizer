# grad-optimizer
gradient descent implementation for basic pure python stuff (not really still use type,numpy all that stuff)
check the benchmark to see the time interartion
i use momentum and vanilla gradient descent for the benchmark
also going to make the test function soon!

probably gonna add other GD model that sound cool
